Georgios completed his undergraduate studies in the Mathematics department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. After that, he joined the M.Sc. program in Computational Science at the Department for Theoretical Physics of Frankfurt University with a specialization on Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience. His doctoral research was supported collaboratively by [Prof. Dr. Roland Memisevic](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~memisevr/) at the University of Frankfurt (2012-2013), [Prof. Dr. Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/) at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley (2013-2014), and [Prof. Dr. Jörg Lücke](https://uol.de/en/machine-learning/) at the University of Oldenburg(2014-2016). As a result, he received the degree of Dr. rer. nat. from the University of Oldenburg on 01.11.2016. He worked as postdoctoral researcher at [Prof. Dr. Stephane Mallat](https://www.di.ens.fr/~mallat/)’s [DATA](https://www.di.ens.fr/data/) team at École Normale Supérieure. Currently, he works at [institut de la vision](http://www.institut-vision.org/).

His research interests revolve around sparse coding, graphical models, deep learning, and theoretical neuroscience. He has studied their applications primarily on spike sorting, receptive field estimation, quantum chemistry, and natural image statistics.
